Video Cutting Script

This Python script splits a video into multiple smaller parts of a fixed duration and saves them in a new folder with sequential filenames.

Requirements:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- MoviePy library

Install MoviePy:
pip install moviepy

Usage:
1. Place the video file in the same folder as the script.
2. Edit the script settings:
   input_video = "anime.mp4"
   part_duration = 20
3. Run the script:
   python video-cutting.py

Output:
- All video parts are saved in the "video_parts" folder
- Files are named sequentially: 1.mp4, 2.mp4, 3.mp4, etc.
- The last part may be shorter if the video length is not evenly divisible

Notes:
- Compatible with the latest MoviePy version
- Videos are encoded using H.264 video and AAC audio

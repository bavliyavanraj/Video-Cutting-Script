Video Reel Cutter – Version 2

Overview:
Version 2 extends the basic video cutting script by converting a full video into multiple
vertical reels (9:16 format) with static text added at the top and bottom of each reel.

This version works by directly running the Python file (no GUI) and is designed to create
social-media-ready reels automatically.

Features:
- Splits the full video into multiple parts of fixed duration
- Converts each part into vertical reel format (1080x1920)
- Adds static top text to every reel
- Adds static bottom text to every reel
- Saves output files with sequential numbering
- No start or end time trimming in this version

Requirements:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- MoviePy
- Pillow
- NumPy

Install Dependencies:
pip install moviepy pillow numpy

Configuration:
Edit the following settings at the top of the script:

INPUT_VIDEO = "input.mp4"
OUTPUT_FOLDER = "output_v2"

PART_SECONDS = 5

TOP_TEXT = "VIDEO PART"
BOTTOM_TEXT = "FOLLOW FOR MORE"

You can also customize:
- Font size
- Font style
- Reel resolution
- Output folder name

Usage:
1. Place the video file in the same folder as the script
2. Update the INPUT_VIDEO filename if needed
3. Adjust text and part duration in the configuration section
4. Run the script using:

python video-cutting.py

Output:
- All generated reels are saved in the "output_v2" folder
- Files are named sequentially:
  1.mp4
  2.mp4
  3.mp4
  ...
- Each reel:
  - Is in vertical (9:16) format
  - Contains static top and bottom text
  - Has a fixed duration (last reel may be shorter)

Notes:
- This version processes the full video automatically
- All values are static and defined in the script
- Start and End time control will be added in Version 3
- Suitable for Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok

Next Version (Version 3):
- Start and End time trimming
- More precise control over video segments
